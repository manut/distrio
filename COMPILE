===============

MPC/ACE/TAO
-----------
The TAO CORBA framework is used by the distrio Manager.
It depends on the MakeProjectCreator (MPC) and on ACE.

You should use the ACE/TAO packages provided by your distribution:

Ubuntu:
^^^^^^^
sudo apt-get install libtao-dev tao-idl tao-cosnaming libtao-orbsvcs-dev \
gperf ace-gperf

If your distribution doesn't have packaged ACE/TAO you can build it by this steps:

	1) git submodule init
	2) git submodule update
	3) cd deps
	4) ./build-acetao.sh

DISTRIO
-------
Generate corba interface code:

	1) make idl

Build libs and binaries:

	2) make

These steps can also be done in the following directories, to build a single
distrio component:

	- common
	- io
	- manager
