MPC/ACE/TAO
-----------
The TAO CORBA framework is used by the distrio Manager.
It depends on the MakeProjectCreator (MPC) and on ACE.

You should use the ACE/TAO packages provided by your distribution. If your
distribution doesn't have packaged ACE/TAO you can build it by this steps:

	1) git submodule init
	2) git submodule update
	3) cd deps
	4) ./build-acetao.sh
